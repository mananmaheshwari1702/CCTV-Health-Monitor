Frontend Audit Report — CCTV Health Monitor
Scope: Full frontend codebase — 13 pages, 2 auth components, 3 context/hook files, types, and 
index.html
 Date: February 2026  |  Mode: Read-only (no code changes applied)

Severity Legend
Icon	Level	Meaning
🔴	Critical	Broken functionality or exploitable security flaw
🟠	High	Significant logic bug or data-integrity risk
🟡	Medium	Code-quality, UX, or moderate correctness issue
🟢	Low	Best-practice suggestion or minor improvement
1 — Security Vulnerabilities
🔴 SEC-01: DeviceDetail reads raw mock data, bypassing role-based filtering
DeviceDetail.tsx

ts
import { devices, tickets, deviceCameras, … } from '../data/mockData';
const device  = devices.find(d => d.id === deviceId);
const deviceTickets = tickets.filter(t => t.deviceId === deviceId);
This page imports raw arrays directly from mockData instead of consuming 
useData()
. Any user who navigates to /devices/:id can see all devices and tickets regardless of role or site assignment — completely bypassing the role-filtered data in 
DataContext
.

Fix: Replace all mockData imports with 
useData()
 hooks (devices, tickets). Camera/stats/timeline data should also be served through the context or a dedicated hook.

🟠 SEC-02: PermissionGuard doesn't enforce admin bypass consistently
PermissionGuard.tsx

ts
if (requiredRole) {
    const roles = Array.isArray(requiredRole) ? requiredRole : [requiredRole];
    if (!roles.includes(user.role)) {
        return <>{fallback}</>;
    }
}
Unlike useAuth.hasPermission (which auto-grants for admin), 
PermissionGuard
 performs a strict role match. If a developer writes <PermissionGuard requiredRole={['manager']}>… the admin is blocked. The two systems contradict each other.

Fix: Add if (user.role === 'admin') return <>{children}</> at the top of the guard, or always include 'admin' in every requiredRole array. Pick one model and enforce it.

🟠 SEC-03: 
hasPermission
 doesn't handle array of roles correctly
useAuth.tsx

ts
const hasPermission = (requiredRole: UserRole | UserRole[]) => {
    if (!user) return false;
    if (user.role === 'admin') return true;
    return user.role === requiredRole; // ← strict equality on array
};
When passed an array, user.role === requiredRole always returns false for non-admin users because it compares a string to an array. This means 
hasPermission(['manager', 'technician'])
 silently fails for managers and technicians.

Fix: const roles = Array.isArray(requiredRole) ? requiredRole : [requiredRole]; return roles.includes(user.role);

🟡 SEC-04: Reports page has no role guard at the page level
Reports.tsx

The route is protected in 
App.tsx
 (allowedRoles: ['admin', 'manager']), but the page component itself has no 
PermissionGuard
 wrapper. If routing is ever restructured, the page has zero self-defense.

Also, the "Generate Now" and "Download Last" buttons have no permission checks — any authenticated user who accesses the page can trigger them.

🟡 SEC-05: CSP allows 'unsafe-inline' for scripts
index.html

script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'
'unsafe-inline' in script-src completely negates XSS protection from the CSP. This is required by Vite's dev server, but a production build must drop it and use nonce-based scripts.

Fix: Split CSP between dev and prod. For production, use script-src 'self' with SRI hashes or nonces.

🟡 SEC-06: ID generation uses Date.now() + Math.random()
Affected files:

Devices.tsx:130
 — dev-${Date.now()}
DeviceDetail.tsx:187
 — tkt-${Date.now()}
TicketDetail.tsx:41
 — cm-${Date.now()}
While 
Tickets.tsx
 was fixed to use crypto.randomUUID(), these other files still use the old insecure pattern. IDs are predictable and may collide.

Fix: Use crypto.randomUUID() everywhere, or create a shared generateId(prefix) utility.

2 — State Management & Data Integrity
🔴 BUG-01: DeviceDetail data is stale / disconnected from context
Same root cause as SEC-01. Because 
DeviceDetail
 reads from raw imports:

Tickets created on the detail page (via the missing-recording modal) call 
addTicket
 on 
DataContext
, but the deviceTickets list doesn't update — it's derived from the immutable import.
Device status changes made elsewhere in the app are invisible here.
A user can create a "Missing Recording" ticket and never see it in the "Related Tickets" section.
🟠 BUG-02: Dashboard avgResponseTime doesn't respect filters
Dashboard.tsx

The filteredData memoization recalculates totalDevices, onlineDevices, activeAlerts, etc. based on filters, but avgResponseTime comes from the global dashboardStats object — even when site/status filters are active. This shows misleading analytics.

Fix: Recompute avgResponseTime inside the filteredData memo using only the filtered ticket set.

🟠 BUG-03: Devices.tsx status summary cards ignore filters
Devices.tsx:208-216

ts
const statusCounts = useMemo(() => {
    const counts = { total: devices.length, online: 0, … };
    devices.forEach(…); // ← uses unfiltered `devices`
    return counts;
}, [devices]);
The summary cards (Total / Online / Offline / Warning) always show unfiltered totals, even when site or status filters are active. The table below shows filtered data, creating a visual mismatch.

Fix: Derive statusCounts from filteredDevices instead of devices.

🟠 BUG-04: Shallow merge in 
updateSettings
 silently drops keys
DataContext.tsx

The 
updateSettings
 function uses spread at only one level of depth. Updating settings.notifications.emailAlerts will overwrite the entire notifications object, dropping smsAlerts, pushNotifications, etc.

Fix: Use a deep-merge utility or per-section update functions (already partially addressed in 
Settings.tsx
 handlers, but the context itself is still vulnerable if called directly).

🟡 BUG-05: Pagination not reset when data changes
Pages affected: 
Tickets.tsx
, 
Alerts.tsx

When a ticket/alert is deleted from a later page, currentPage can become invalid (pointing beyond the new totalPages). The user sees an empty page until they manually navigate back.

Fix: Add a useEffect that clamps currentPage to [1, totalPages] whenever the data length changes.

🟡 BUG-06: formData in Devices defaults to first site at mount time
Devices.tsx:79

ts
siteId: sites[0]?.id || ''
If sites is still loading or empty when the component mounts, the default is ''. Later, when sites arrive, the default isn't updated. The user opens the "Add Device" modal with no site selected and the form silently submits with an empty siteId.

Fix: Initialize siteId in 
handleOpenModal
 (or 
resetForm
) at open-time, not at mount-time.

3 — Logic Errors
🟡 LOGIC-01: Ticket badge in DeviceDetail only shows danger or warning
DeviceDetail.tsx:656-660

ts
variant={ticket.priority === 'critical' ? 'danger' : 'warning'}
Priorities can be low, medium, high, or critical, but only two badge variants are used. low and medium tickets are both rendered as warning, which is misleading.

🟡 LOGIC-02: Reports quick stats are fully hardcoded
Reports.tsx:87-127

Values like "24 Reports Generated", "156 Total Downloads", "2h ago" are static JSX literals. They never change and provide false information to users.

Fix: Either connect to real report metadata or clearly label them as demo data.

🟡 LOGIC-03: Device type dropdown options mismatch type definitions
Devices.tsx:507-511

The dropdown offers camera, nvr, server, but the 
Device
 type expects 'camera' | 'nvr' | 'dvr' | 'switch'. dvr and switch are missing; server isn't a valid type. This creates data that doesn't match the type icons on line 45–50.

4 — Performance Concerns
🟡 PERF-01: DataContext re-renders all consumers on any state change
DataContext
 holds seven pieces of state in a single provider. Any call to 
addTicket
, 
updateAlert
, etc. triggers a re-render of every consumer (
Dashboard
, 
Tickets
, 
Alerts
, 
Sites
, 
Devices
, etc.) — even if they only care about one slice.

Fix: Split into domain-specific contexts (e.g., TicketContext, AlertContext, DeviceContext) or use useSyncExternalStore / state selection libraries.

🟡 PERF-02: DeviceDetail calendar renders 31 × N buttons every render
The recording calendar grid renders cameras.length × daysInMonth interactive buttons. For 8 cameras and 31 days = 248 buttons per render. The recordingDataMap optimization helps lookup, but each button still creates a tooltip div. Memoizing camera rows would reduce re-render cost.

🟢 PERF-03: Profile re-initializes form state on every render
Profile.tsx

formData is re-derived from user on every render cycle. Should be initialized once with useEffect on user changes.

5 — Missing Test Coverage
No test files were found (*.test.*, *.spec.*) in the entire src/ directory.

There are zero unit, integration, or e2e tests for:

Authentication flow and role checks
DataContext CRUD operations and filtering
PermissionGuard rendering logic
Pagination edge cases
Form validation (Login password policy, device/ticket creation)
Recommendation: Prioritize tests for:

PermissionGuard
 role logic (especially admin bypass)
DataContext
 filtering and CRUD
Login
 password validation + 2FA flow
Pagination boundary conditions
